🧬 Dataset Generation

How the code generates stochastic genotype data and tree sequences for ancestral inference models and dashboards.

## 🌍 Population Ancestry Dataset Outputs

These files are generated by `data_generation.py`. Unlike family-based scripts, this uses a coalescent framework to simulate deep ancestry, recombination, and mutation across a population of individuals.

### 📂 Output Files (Family Simulation)

| File                                     | Description                                                                                                             | Key Contents / Columns                                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`datasets/*.trees`**                   | The Tree Sequence file. The gold standard for genomic data; contains the full genealogical history and ground truth.    | Nodes, Edges, Sites, and Mutations.                                     |
| **`datasets/*.truth_genotypes.csv`**     | The Ground Truth dosage matrix. Contains true genotypes for all simulated individuals at every variant site.            | `site_index`, `position`, `ind_0000` to `ind_N` (values $0, 1, 2$).     |
| **`datasets/*.observed_genotypes*.txt`** | The Input Data for models. A copy of the truth matrix with genotypes randomly masked (NaN) based on the `masking_rate`. | Identical schema to truth, but contains `NaN` values.                   |
| **`datasets/*.sites*.txt`**              | Metadata for every genetic variant discovered in the simulation.                                                        | `site_index`, `position`, `ancestral_state`, `derived_states`.          |
| **`datasets/*.sample_metadata*.txt`**    | Mapping file connecting haploid sample nodes to diploid individuals.                                                    | `sample_index`, `node_id`, `individual_index`, `hap_within_individual`. |
| **`datasets/*.run_metadata*.txt`**       | Replay File. Contains every parameter and seed used. Can be fed back into the script to perfectly replicate the run.    | `params`, `derived` stats, `created_at`.                                |

### ⚙️ How `data_generation.py` Works

This script focuses on Probabilistic Ancestral Inference. It simulates how genetic material is passed down through generations in a large population:

- **Coalescent Ancestry:** Uses `msprime.sim_ancestry` to model the stochastic "backbone" of the data (recombination and coalescence) based on effective population size ($N_e$).
- **Mutation Overlay:** Adds mutations to the tree sequence to create observable genotypes.
- **Diploid Conversion:** Converts raw haploid data into diploid dosage ($0, 1, 2$) to mimic real-world human SNP data.
- **Controlled Missingness:** Applies a random mask to the dosage matrix. This simulates low-coverage sequencing or genotyping failures, creating the "Observed" dataset.
- **Validation Logic:** If the simulation randomly produces fewer than the `--min-variants` requested, the script automatically increments the seed and retries until a sufficient dataset is generated.

### ⚙️ Example Command

run `source .venv/bin/activate` to activate the python environment.

```bash
python data_generation.py \
  --name public \
  --n-diploid-samples 500 \
  --sequence-length 200000 \
  --mutation-rate 1e-7 \
  --masking-rate 0.20 \
  --seed 42
```

Meta Replay (Reproducibility): To recreate an exact dataset using a previous run's metadata:

```bash
python data_generation.py --meta-in my_simulations/population_run.run_metadata.json
```

### 🧠 Understanding the Data

| Column Name            | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`site_index`**       | A unique, zero-indexed integer assigned to each variant site identified during the simulation.                                                                              |
| **`position`**         | The physical location of the mutation along the DNA sequence. This value will be between 0 and your specified `--sequence-length`.                                          |
| **`ancestral_state`**  | The original genetic "letter" (allele) present in the population before any mutations occurred at that specific site.                                                       |
| **`derived_states`**   | The new genetic "letter" (allele) that appeared due to a mutation. In these simulations, a "0" usually represents the ancestral state and "1" represents the derived state. |
| **`ind_0000 - ind_n`** | Each column (e.g., ind_0000, ind_0001) corresponds to a single diploid individual.                                                                                          |

#### Ind_XXXX Values

Dosage Values: The numbers in these columns are genotype dosages. Because these are diploid individuals (having two sets of chromosomes), the values represent the count of the "derived" allele at that site:

- 0: Homozygous for the ancestral allele (neither chromosome has the mutation).
- 1: Heterozygous (one chromosome has the mutation, the other does not).
- 2: Homozygous for the derived allele (both chromosomes have the mutation).
- NaN: In the observed_genotypes.csv, this indicates a missing value where the data was "masked" or hidden to simulate real-world sequencing gaps.
